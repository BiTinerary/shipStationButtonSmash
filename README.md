# shipStationButtonSmashCounter<br>
This is a counter for the number of times a custom button is pressed that I made/created/installed at work. <br>
Not so much for practicality, it saves only about 1/2 second/press or 1/2 the total keystrokes, but conceptually has broadened my tech aptitude. <br>
<br>
It's primary use is just to be more cathartic in smashing a gigantic switch everytime something is sold and shipped. <br>
As opposed to pressing <kbd>Alt+P</kbd> or swapping from the keyboard to the mouse. <br>
<br>
Keystrokes not pressed: **<kbd>1297</kbd>**<br>
Time saved: **<kbd>10.81</kbd>** minutes
