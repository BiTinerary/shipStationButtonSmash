# shipStationButtonSmashCounter<br>
This is a counter for the number of times a custom button is pressed that I made/created/installed at work.<br>
Press button, print shipping label.

Not so much for practicality, it saves only about 1/2 second/press (1/2 the total keystrokes) but conceptually has broadened my tech aptitude into Arduino.<br>
<br>
It's primary use is just to be more cathartic in smashing a gigantic switch everytime something is sold and shipped. <br>
As opposed to pressing <kbd>Alt+P</kbd> or swapping from the keyboard to the mouse. <br>

I use a $5 switch and a ~$1 digispark <a href='https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-1PCS-LOT-GY-Digispark-kickstarter-miniature-minimal-development-board-ATTINY85-module-for-Arduino-usb/32673631021.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.U4yBFt'>attiny85</a>. The switch wired between pin 2 and GND. The particular switch I'm using also had an incandescent bulb option. I removed that and modified it for an LED. The entire thing was wrapped in electrical tape, a hole was measured and drilled. The switch included a locking washer and mounted quite nicely.<br>
<br>
Keystrokes **not** pressed: **<kbd>3965</kbd>**<br>
Time saved: **<kbd>33.04</kbd>** minutes<br>
**<kbd>10.0</kbd>** miles of tape used<br>
